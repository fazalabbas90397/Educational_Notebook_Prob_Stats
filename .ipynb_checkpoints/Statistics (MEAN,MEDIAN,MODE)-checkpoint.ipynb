    "## KEY STATISTICAL TERMS \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Mean:** The mean is a measure of central tendency in statistics. It is also commonly known as the \"average.\" To calculate the mean of a set of numbers, we add up all the values and then divide the sum by the total number of values. The mean helps us understand the typical value in the dataset and provides a representative value that is somewhere in the middle of the data.\n",
    " \n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">\n",
    "<b>Example:</b> Suppose we have the following test scores: 85, 90, 78, 95, and 87. To find the mean, we add all the scores together: 85 + 90 + 78 + 95 + 87 = 435. Next, we divide the sum by the total number of scores (which is 5 in this case): 435 ÷ 5 = 87. The mean test score is 87.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Data Sum:** The data sum is the result of adding up all the data points in a dataset. It is the total of all the values we have in our set of numbers. The data sum is an essential component in calculating various statistical measures, including the mean, median, and range.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">\n",
    "<b>Example:</b> Continuing with the previous example of test scores: 85, 90, 78, 95, and 87. The data sum is found by adding all the scores together: 85 + 90 + 78 + 95 + 87 = 435.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Number of Data Points:** The number of data points represents the total count of values in a dataset. It tells us how many pieces of data we have. In other words, it's the total number of values that are part of our set.\n",
    " \n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">\n",
    "<b>Example:</b>  For the same test scores example: 85, 90, 78, 95, and 87, there are five scores in the dataset. Therefore, the number of data points is 5.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***In summary,*** the **mean is the average value of a set of numbers,** calculated by **adding up all the values and dividing the sum by the total count of data points.** The **data sum** is the **total result of adding all the values in the dataset,** and the number of **data points** represents the **total count of values in the set.** Understanding these key statistical terms is crucial for interpreting and analyzing data effectively.\n"
